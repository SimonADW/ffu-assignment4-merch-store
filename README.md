## Kristiania Frontend 2024 - Assigment 4 - Simon Winter  
### Assignment summary:
The final project aims to showcase your proficiency in coding and design, integrating the skills acquired in the first semester, and the latest knowledge acquired during the second semester. You are free to come up with your own ideas for the final project. 

### School project, not intended for commercial use
The project is a fictional band-merch store. 

For the API, I have "Upcoming concert"-type banner on the landing page, with data from TIcketmaster API.

Authentication is done via firestore, with email and password. 

The store fetches the products from Firestore, and the cart is stored in localStorage. Upon checkout the order is stored in a separate collection in firestore.
